# Cinder_Week7_OSC
Two Player game using two different computers that send and listen to signals being sent from one another using OSC.

Goal:
The objective is to hit the green ball on the screen with your colored ball. One player is the red ball and the other player is the blue ball. Each time you hit the green ball, you recieve a point and the green ball resets into a new position. Gather as many points in the time frame given. Player with the most points win.

Instructions
Your balls are tethered to the center of the screen. Everytime you mouse click, your ball will spin faster causing the tethered chain to rotate faster. As you continuously click your ball will get closer towards the center due to the speed increase. Time your mouse clicks in order to precisely hit the green ball.
